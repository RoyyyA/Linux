### most useful commands for process, cpu, memory, ... that I'm using most frequently ###

# check pid of a process for example mongo
piof service_name
ps aux | grep -i service_name

# check top five cpu using processes
ps aux --sort=-pcpu | head -n 5

# check top five memory using processes
ps aux --sort=-pmem | head -n 5

# killing process using kill and killadll cmds
kill -9 pid
killall process_name
killall -9 process_name

### SWAPPINESS
# check swappiness value
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

# edit swappiness value
nano /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

# check which process has the most swap :
ps axo %cpu,%mem,command | sort -nr

# check whcih process in using the most of the swap
for file in /proc/*/status; do awk '/VmSwap|Name/{prontf $2 " " $3}END{print ""}' $file; done
 
# check the proccess id (eg: pid is 77141)
ps -p 77141 
# if there was a swap it means that the process has used swap if not the process has not used the swap
/proc/77141/ (+ tab twice ) 

# Checking mem space
free -m 
free -h
# Disable swap
swapoff -a 
# Wait for approximately 30 seconds and use free -m 
# Enable swap
swapon -a 

# check load average
uptime
cat /proc/loadavg

# check background processes
jobs
# bring a process forward
fg job_number
# get a process background such as htop (to run htop cmd in the background)
htop &
